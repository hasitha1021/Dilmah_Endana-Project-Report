The Project: Restoring Sinharajaâ€™s Lost Forest

Dilmah is doing remarkable work in this areaâ€”reforesting parts of Sinharaja that were destroyed during colonial times due to tea plantations and human settlement. The goal is to create a forest corridor connecting two mountain rangesâ€”Walankanda and Ihara Kandaâ€”to promote biodiversity and ecological balance.

What impressed me the most was the scientific approach behind the restoration. Itâ€™s not just about planting trees; it involves:
âœ” Detailed data collection (soil quality, environmental conditions)
âœ” Native species selection (seeds sourced from different parts of Sinharaja)
âœ” Community involvement (providing economic benefits to locals through beekeeping & sustainable farming)

What I Learned â€“ Beyond Academics

Though my background is in Industrial Statistics & Mathematical Finance, this project showed me how data science, finance, and environmental conservation intersect. Concepts from Quality Control, Project Management, and Financial Mathematics became real-world tools in planning and monitoring the restoration.

But beyond the technical side, the best part was being immersed in nature for five days. Thereâ€™s something deeply fulfilling about working with trees, wildlife, and a team passionate about making a difference.

A Big Thank You!
Huge respect to Dilmah for this initiativeâ€”while itâ€™s still under the radar in Sri Lanka, globally, many are watching and supporting such efforts.
Special thanks to:
ðŸŒ¿ Mr. Hasranga â€“ For guiding us throughout the project.
ðŸŒ¿ Mr. Amila â€“ For flawlessly managing the program.
ðŸŒ¿ Ruvini Akka, the Rajarata University team, and the locals who welcomed us warmly.
ðŸŒ¿ Morgan (who flew in from Australia!) and my amazing teammatesâ€”this wouldnâ€™t have been the same without you.
This was just Phase 1â€”more reflections on the project coming soon!
